## Overview

Not gonna include much for this one; just trying out Frontend Mentor. This project is relatively staightforward CSS and HTML, but then again I'm just beginning to learn this really

### What I learned

How to import from Google Fonts, a bit more about how grid works, aligning items vs. aligning content, what percentage values are relative to, how to hide the scroll bar, a case for making use of border-box

### Continued development

Still need to become proficient with grid and flex, get to really know the nuances in their differences

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Good ol'. For more specific issues that others may have faced before me
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Helpful low-level detail on different properties, attributes, etc.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Good with explaining more fundamental concepts in case of lapses
